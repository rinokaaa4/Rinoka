            <p>I have known Ng Peirong since junior high school - it's been about eight years now. He is truly my best friend. He can almost always guess what's on my mind, even before I have the chance to express it. No matter what I go through, he can fully understand me and unconditionally support me. To me, he is the best friend in the entire world, the entire universe.</p>
            <p>Lim Zhonghua was also a friend I met since junior high school. To me, he was a very important friend. I often jokingly called him "Young Master". He was very easy to get along with, had an extremely gentle personality, and was always ready to help others - almost like a real artificial robot. Being with him always made people feel relaxed and happy. Even if there was no topic to talk about, it wouldn't be very awkward because he was just a person who wasn't good at expressing himself.</p>
            <p>Bong Chingyou was a good friend I made during my high school years. We quickly formed a deep and meaningful friendship. We often went to the beach to watch the sunrise and sunset together. We enjoyed eating delicious food, getting manicures, playing mahjong, and chatting while drinking, discussing the future and our dreams. She was the kind of person who could bring joy and warmth to you simply by being by your side, and I cherished every moment we spent together.</p>
